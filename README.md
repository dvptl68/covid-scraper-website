# [COVID-19 Web Scraper - Website](http://covid19reports.epizy.com/) :email:
An automated web scraper that sends you daily COVID-19 data report emails.

***The code for the web scraper can be found [here](https://github.com/dvptl68/covid-scraper).***
## How to sign up:
Visit [this website](http://covid19reports.epizy.com/) to sign up to receive daily COVID-19 data report emails. You will be asked to select a country and enter your name and email. If you select the United States, you may also (optionally) select a state and county.  
  
If you register twice with different selections and the same email you will receive multiple emails for each selection. If you register twice with the same sleections and same emails *you will still receive multiple emails*.  
  
Every email has an unsubscribe link at the bottom, so you can opt-out of every location you register to receive emails for.

## How it works:
This sign-up website is hosted with [InfinityFree](https://infinityfree.net/), using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript as the front-end tools, and PHP for the web server. An in-depth description of the enitre project can be viewed at the [main web scraper repository](https://github.com/dvptl68/covid-scraper).
